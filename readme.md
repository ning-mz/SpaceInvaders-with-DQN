# SpaceInvaders-with-DQN<br>
Hi, this is a tiny algorithm to run the spaceinvaders game by using DQN and CNN.

This program run the game from OpenAI gym and in the environment of OpenAI universe. 

Operating System is Ubuntu16.04

Libraries: OpenAI gym, OpenAI universe, Tensorflow-GPU-1.12.0, CUDA9, OpenCV3, Numpy



(PS: On my computer, every first time I start openai universe after turn on the computer, it will crash, so just use the same command to run code again, it will be good to go. Thank you!)

Run the training: open a new terminal and cd to the path of this folder, then do "sudo python training.py" Than wait for game show in the new window.

Run the testing: open a new terminal and cd to the path of this folder, then do "sudo python testing.py" Than wait for game show in the new window.

For further information please see the report document.
